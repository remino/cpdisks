USAGE: cpdisks [<options>] <source disk> <destination dir>

Copy several disks one by one in a single directory.

This will copy the contents of the disk to the destination directory under a
subdirectory named after the disk. The disk will be ejected after copying and
the process will wait for the next disk to be inserted.

To end the process, press Ctrl+C.

Works best on macOS. On other platforms, the disk must be ejected manually.

OPTIONS:
